## rip for Reddit

It's a simple image downloader CLI tool for reddit

It downloads images from URLs that look like images

It has a few configurable options as well

## Features
(Note: I have not tested all combinations of features, you might encounter some bugs!)

* Set max size limit for media download (in KBs)

* Fetch top / best / new / rising entries using -sort option

* Assign a karma threshold (default 1)

* If the image / gif is already downloaded, skip it.

* Can log final URLs to a file.

* Primitive support for scraping pages that don't end with media extensions, using -og-type flag.

## Build
Assuming you have Go toolchain installed

```
go install github.com/mahesh-hegde/reddit-rip
```

or

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mahesh-hegde/reddit-rip.git
cd reddit-rip
go build
```

your executable is "reddit-rip" or "reddit-rip.exe" depending on OS, saved in same folder.

## Note about windows
I wrote this on Linux. May not work well on Windows. A best-effort default option is enabled to sanitize filenames so that they can be saved on Windows / Android. But don't blame me if you face some quirks of Windows OS. 

## Usage
```

  -max-size int
        Max size of media file in KB, -1 for no limit (default -1)
  -max-storage int
        Data usage limit in MB, -1 for no limit (default -1)
  -min-karma int
        Minimum Karma of the post
  -og-type string
        Look Up for a media link in page's og:property if link itself is not image/video (experimental) supported: video, image, any
  -sort string
        Sort: best|hot|new|rising|top-<all|year|month|week|day>
  -special-chars
        Allow all characters in filenames except / and \, And windows-special filenames like NUL
  -useragent string
        UserAgent string (default "rip for Reddit / Command Line Tool")
  -v    Enable verbose output
```

**Note:**

* -d implies -v

* use -log-media-links=filename option with -d (dry run) if you just want to log media URLs and not download them.

* some sites like gfycat don't provide downloadable URLs directly, you might try passing -og-type=video for example, so that the program will try to scrape "og:video" property from the link. Supported options are video, image, or any (first try to find og:video, or fallback to og:image)

* I have not tested all combinations of options, you might discover some bugs !!
